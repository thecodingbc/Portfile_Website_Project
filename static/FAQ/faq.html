                                When I was in P3, I joined in my school's Robotic CCA. Since then I have become very interested in coding. In CCA we use Scratch and Ev3 for robot programming learning. I felt that the coding lessons were very interesting and fun!

                                I joined the CCA competition team and participated in the 2019/2020 First Lego League Challenge on behalf of the school. In the same year, I began to check the relevant Coding learning materials on the website and library, and began use Scratch to make my favorite games. Not long after, I start getting in touch with Python.

                                At P5, I started to learn Python systematically, participated in the training course of coding lab, and participated in the International Coding Showcase 2021 and awarded Distinction in the Ages 10 to 12(Python)Category ,and Judges'Choice (Most Innovative) achievement during my study .At the same time, I also learned to use EV3 for robot programming learning at NK Robotic. And represented NK T3 in the First Lego League Singapore 2021/2022 and achieved totally 350 marks for our project. I also designed an automatic dish return robot myself, in order to reduce the burden of the staff in the food court and improve time efficiency

                                When I reached P6, I started to study how to build website, and made some website using Java, CSS HTML respectively. In the same year, I even participated in the youth group of theintermediate level, 13th Lanqiao Cup China Software and Information Technology Professionals Competition, and won the third prize ! On behalf of the school, I also participated in the peihwa hackthon competition microbit and Hwa Chong Infocommunications(HCIC) 2022, hoeevr the results have not being released yet. I hope that I can overcome difficulties on the learning path of coding, keep exploring, and become a professional coder in the future.
